In this current iteration we removed non-latin text and stopwords.
We removed stopwords due to their frequency, and the non-latin text to prevent issues with having to interpret text, and the mixing of languages.

Next we will finish cleaning up any remaining issues with punctuation to create a finished vector of feature values.
