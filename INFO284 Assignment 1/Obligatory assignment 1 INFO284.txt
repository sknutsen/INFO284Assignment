Obligatory assignment 1, INFO284
Students: skn003, tre081

In this current iteration we removed non-latin text and stopwords.
We removed stopwords due to their frequency, and the non-latin text to prevent issues with having to interpret text, and the mixing of languages.
In order to assure accurate removal of the non-latin characters we created an extra column that combined title, author and text. Because of this we didn't 
have to rely on the characters being the same in all three fields.

Next we will finish cleaning up any remaining issues with punctuation to create a finished vector of feature values.
